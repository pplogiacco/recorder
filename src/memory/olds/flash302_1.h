  @File Name
    flash.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the FLASH driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for FLASH.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.170.0
        Device            :  PIC24FV32KA302
        Driver Version    :  1.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.61
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X v5.45
